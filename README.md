## Summary

Overall, men appear to use the service significantly more in New York than non-males, and subscribers use the service noticeably more than non-subscribers. Therefore, a bike-sharing program for Des Moines would be well-served marketing towards male riders, and pushing a membership/subscriber program. The majority of users use the service in New York for less than an hour. During the week, usage is mostly in the morning and after work lets off (matching most rush-hour times). On the weekends, most usage occurs on Saturday, though Sunday usage is still generally higher throughout the day than on weekdays. 
To further explore this data, we could analyze the usage of the service based on age, and we could also determine if certain stations see patterns of usage based on start station id and end station id.
